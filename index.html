            <summary>Machine Learning Basics</summary>
            <p>A machine "learns" by identifying patterns in data and improving its
            ability to perform specific tasks without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.
            This learning process helps machines to make accurate predictions or decisions based on the information they receive. 
            Unlike traditional programming where instructions are fixed, ML allows models to adapt and improve through experience.</p>

            <summary>Python for Machine Learning</summary>
            <p>Python language is widely used in Machine Learning because it provides libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn,
             TensorFlow, and Keras. These libraries offer tools and functions essential for data manipulation, analysis, and building
             machine learning models. It is well-known for its readability and offers platform independence. These all things make it 
             the perfect language of choice for Machine Learning.</p>

            <summary>Feature Engineering</summary>
            <p>Feature Engineering is the process of selecting, creating or modifying features like input variables or data to help machine
             learning models learn patterns more effectively. It involves transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that improve model
             accuracy and performance.</p>

            <summary>Supervised Learning</summary>
            <p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model learns from labelled data—meaning every input has a corresponding
                 correct output. The model makes predictions and compares them with the true outputs, adjusting itself to reduce errors and improve 
                accuracy over time. The goal is to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. For example, a model trained on images of handwritten 
                digits can recognise new digits it has never seen before.</p>

            <summary>Unsupervised Learning</summary>
            <p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that analyzes and models data without labelled responses or predefined categories.
                 Unlike supervised learning, where the algorithm learns from input-output pairs, unsupervised learning algorithms work solely with 
                 input data and aim to discover hidden patterns, structures or relationships within the dataset independently, without any human 
                 intervention or prior knowledge of the data's meaning.</p>

            <summary>Model Evaluation and Tuning</summary>
            <p>When building machine learning models, it’s important to understand how well they perform. Evaluation metrics help us to measure
                 the effectiveness of our models. Whether we are solving a classification problem, predicting continuous values or clustering data,
                  selecting the right evaluation metric allows us to assess how well the model meets our goals. In this article, we will see commonly
                   used evaluation metrics and discuss how to choose the right metric for our model.</p>

            <summary>Advanced Techniques</summary>
            <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning that focuses on how agents can learn to make decisions through trial and 
                error to maximize cumulative rewards. RL allows machines to learn by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback based on
             their actions. This feedback comes in the form of rewards or penalties.</p>

            <b>Machine learning</b> is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers 
            learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand
            like humans by learning from the data.
